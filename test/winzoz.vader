Given vim (Empty file is enough):

Do (Split vertically, move right, split horizontally, move down, go normal mode, move up one line):
  \<space>wvlsj\<esc>k

Then (Current win is the expected position in the layout):
  AssertEqual win_getid(), winlayout()[1][1][1][1][1]

Execute (Save current number of tabs (it's not trivially 1, as Vader takes its own tab)):
  let numtabs = tabpagenr('$')

Do (Move current window to new tab, move up one line):
  \<space>wT\<esc>k

Then (Tab 2 is active):
  let newnumtabs = tabpagenr('$')
  AssertEqual newnumtabs, numtabs + 1

Do (Close 2 of the 3 windows, go normal mode, move up one line):
  \<space>wqq\<esc>k

Then (Last window standing):
  AssertEqual winlayout()[0], 'leaf'
  AssertEqual winlayout()[1], win_getid()
