The plugin for easy window navigation.

Demo
----

![WinZoZ demo][1]

([This is the lovely animal in the background.][2])

Usage
-----

Upon installing the plugin,

  - <kbd>\<leader\></kbd><kbd>w</kbd> will turn on the WinZoZ mode (a colored status bar will make it apparent):
    - every key pressed when this mode is active will be interpreted as if you pressed it after hitting <kbd>Ctrl-W</kbd>;
  - by hitting <kbd>Escape</kbd> you'll go back to normal mode.

Customization points
--------------------

  - If you're not happy with <kbd>\<leader\></kbd><kbd>w</kbd>, you can define `g:winzoz_trigger` in your `vimrc`.
  - When the WinZoZ mode is active, the status bar is colored with the `Search` highlight group. You can change this by defining `g:winzoz_style` as you prefer.
  - There's an option to disable the plugin, but why doing it?

Installation
------------

However you like. I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).


Motivation
----------

Long story short, resizing windows has always been a pain for me and, with a large screen and many open windows, even pressing <kbd>Ctrl-W</kbd> several times has become a pain.

Since [I did not find an existing plugin addressing this need][3], I started reading [Learn Vimscript the Hard Way][4], which made me thing I could write a plugin myself, so I did it and had it [reviewed on CodeReview][5], and here it is.

Why WinZoZ? [Oh, wellâ€¦][6]
